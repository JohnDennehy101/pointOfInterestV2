# Enterprise Web Development Module - Point of Interest Web Application

#### Student Name: John Dennehy Student ID: 20091408

## Introduction

“A “point of interest” (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic
address. POI data has many applications, including augmented reality browsers, location- based social networking games, geocaching,
mapping and navigation systems.”

I chose to focus on Irish national monuments for this assignment.
